# BlazorAudioPlayer
Audio player built with client side Blazor. 

## Description
Simple audio player written in C# using client-side blazor. 
As a base i used Howler.js audio player demo and tried to replicate the functionality using blazor.

Features implemented what were present in the original example:
* Controls: play, pause, previous, volume.
* Playlist support
* Real-time playback progress.

Features not implemented:
* I decided not to include the outside framework [SiriWave.js](https://github.com/CaffeinaLab/SiriWaveJS) what was used
in the oiriginal Howler.js audio player demo.
* Seeking in audio file. (Simple to add with one onclick event to html element.)
